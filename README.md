# psi_hdi

This repository contains code and data used to study the relationship between the
asymptomatic fraction (ψ) of infections and the Human Development Index (HDI),
using serological survey data and statistical modeling.

## Background

Estimating the proportion of asymptomatic infections is challenging due to
symptom overlap with other illnesses, recall bias, and imperfect diagnostic tests.
This project analyzes serosurvey data to obtain less biased estimates of the
asymptomatic fraction (ψ) and investigates its association with country-level
socioeconomic indicators, particularly HDI.

The repository supports analyses presented in ongoing and submitted research
manuscripts.
